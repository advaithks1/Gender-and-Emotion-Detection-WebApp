A custom-trained gender detection model

OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade for fast and accurate face detection

Flask to serve the live video stream via a simple, responsive web interface

Features
Real-time gender and emotion prediction with live webcam input

Lightweight and optimized models for smooth performance

Interactive browser interface powered by Flask and HTML5 video streaming

Easily extensible and customizable for additional facial analysis tasks

Usage
Run the Flask app locally to open a live webcam feed in your browser

Detect and display gender and emotion labels over detected faces

Open source and modular for education, research, or integration into other projects
